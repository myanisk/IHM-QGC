We customize QGroundControl by making modifications to its resources.

## Overview

QGroundControl is a powerful open-source ground control station software used for controlling drones and other unmanned vehicles. Customizing its interface and behavior can be essential for specific use cases. One way to achieve this customization is by modifying its resources.
